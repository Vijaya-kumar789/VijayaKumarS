        Currently, Completed a comprehensive MERN stack course at Guvi, where I
        developed a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end
        technologies, with where I gained hands-on
        experience with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. My training has
        equipped me with the skills needed to build dynamic, end-to-end web
        applications, and Iâ€™m excited to apply this knowledge to real-world
        projects. Scroll down to see some of the projects I've been working on.
